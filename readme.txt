## Streamlined Flask Project Setup

This script helps you kickstart Flask projects with a virtual environment and basic structure.

**Need Flask?** Install it with `pip install Flask`.

**How to Use:**

1. Download & extract the script (e.g., `.zip`).
2. Navigate to the extracted folder (e.g., `cd flask_starter`).
3. Run the script: `./install.sh`

This creates a project directory and virtual environment.
